# Morpheus
An Open, Decentralized and Permissionless Framework for Bringing On-Demand Web2 Data to Web3
Morpheus is a framework that allows developers to request any API from web2, directly onchain for their web3 apps. This tool enables real-time data requests, any API and data to be used, and can be used on any EVM network. Morpheus has been designed to make it easier for developers to build decentralized applications that can interact with the real world, thereby bridging the gap between web2 and web3.
One of the most significant advantages of Morpheus is its ability to access any API endpoint. This means that developers can now easily request data from sources such as social media platforms, weather APIs, and financial data APIs directly on the blockchain. This makes it possible to build applications that are more relevant to the real world such as insurance, synthetics, social dapps and that can provide more value to users.
Morpheus is also designed to be network-agnostic, which means that it can be used on any EVM network. This makes it easier for developers to build applications that are not limited to a particular blockchain, but that can be used on any network that supports EVM.
Morpheus is an exciting new tool that is set to revolutionize the way developers build decentralized applications. By enabling real-time data requests and access to any API endpoint, Morpheus makes it easier to create applications that are more relevant to the real world. With its network-agnostic design, Morpheus can be used on any EVM network, making it a powerful tool for developers looking to build decentralized applications.
